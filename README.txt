How to work it:
Under the debug folder is an exe of my game, it is connect for in C++. Since I plan on using
the intel camera for the final project I downloaded the SDK and set it up on visual studio 
including the SDK into the project, adding the libraries, optimizing and such. However since
we could not use the cameras the SDK is useless so I did the next best thing. I took a screen
shot of having the Intel SDK installed to prove that I did. Connect for is a 2 player game
where you enter which column you want to drop your peice (1-7).
